  <h1>About this place</h1>

  <p>
    This is a quiet space to explore kanji.  
    Not as a task, not as a test — but as something living.
  </p>

  <p>
    Writing these characters slowly helps me feel calm.  
    They connect language, memory, and presence in ways that go beyond words.
  </p>

  <p>
    I made this project to heal, to play, to breathe.  
    If you're here, maybe you need that too.  
    Welcome
